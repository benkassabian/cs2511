Both the Abstract Factory and Factory Method are creational design patterns that involve an interface to produce objects from.
The Abstract Factory differs in that its intent is to allow the software to create different related/dependent objects without defining their concrete classes.
The Factory Method however allows the creation of one object but allows its subclasses to instantiate it and decide which class to instantiate the object under.
